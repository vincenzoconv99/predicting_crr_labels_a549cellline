# Predicting Cis Regulatory Regions Labels in A549 cell line

The prediction of tissue specific active regulatory regions in the human genome is a relevant problem in Bioinformatics
and Molecular Biology. Indeed only when regulatory regions, such as promoters and enhancers, are active in a specific
cell the transcription factors and the molecular machinery can exert their role to regulate the expression of specific
genes. In this project we will develop deep neural models able to predict whether a specific non-coding regulatory
regions (e.g. a promoter or an enhancer) are active or not in a specific cell, using the nucleotide sequences of DNA and
the epigenetic data associated with each regulatory region. 
The project focuses on learning how to construct the models and design sound experimental procedures to obtain statistically 
reliable results.
